Password Manager is a web application developed with the framework Symfony 3, as part of my professional activities.
This application is intended to facilitate the management of passwords



These objectives:

- Secure management of password storage.
- Transversality of the use of these passwords in the context of work.
- Propose a tool with a simple interface with an adminstration access
